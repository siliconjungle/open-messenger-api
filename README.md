# open-messenger-api

## What is an Open Messenger API?
An API which acts as a gateway between social applications. Your phone service provider doesn't force you to only communicate with people who have the same provider as you. Why should your applications?

This is a service to store contact lists for user's as well as methods of sending messages to those contact's which sits outside of the applications which use them.

## As a user, how does this impact me?
As a user, you will no longer be confined to using a social platform simply because all your friends are using it. You can choose whatever alternative you like which integrates our api.
